Slide Preparation Standard Operating Procedure
---

Document Revision: 1.0

# 1. PURPOSE

This document is a standard operating procedure for the use of providing guidance in the preparation and analysis of air filters by xRfiber, a Phase Contrast Microscope (PCM).
xRfiber comprises a motorized microscope that is wirelessly operated by an iPad, and a software to drive the microscope. It is dedicated to the measurement of fibers in air samples, following a large number of standards or recommendations in accordance with local rules. The microscope is operated in phase contrast, the images are captured by an iPhone or iPad and analyzed locally by means of an embedded artificial intelligence.

Although training is provided when a unit is deployed in a laboratory, this document should also be read, understood and referred to when questions arise.
If information is requested, particularly if relevant and not found in the document, the user is welcome to contact [support@xrapid-group.com][1] for any further questions.


# 2. CONTEXT

- These instructions are for the use of researchers, technicians and operators in general who are performing air fiber sample diagnostics.
- This SOP contains general guidelines for the preparation and analysis of air fiber samples only. Please refer to relevant standards for xRfiber operation.
- This SOP is not a substitute for the preparation of slide samples. This serves as a guide within the frame of standards and/or recommendations.

# 3. SAFETY NOTES

- Ensure your working surface is clean and free of debris.
- Wear protective clothing, gloves and goggles when preparing the slides, and operating the microscope.
- Exercise caution when using the scalpel to cut the air filter cartridges.
- Avoid inhaling any chemicals you are working with. 
- If at any point you feel dizzy or unwell, stop what you are doing. Secure your station and get fresh air immediately.

# 4. PREREQUISITES

The following are required for the preparation of air fiber sample slides:

- A cleared and clean laboratory space, if possible with constant lighting and in a low vibration environment
- Safety equipment as outlined above under Equipment Specifications (Section 2.1.4)
- At least one dedicated technician

## 5. RESPONSIBILITIES

It is the responsibility of the user to ensure that:

- Slides are prepared in a sterile environment
- Slides are created following proper instructions
- Any contaminated slides or air fiber cartridges are discarded
- A copy of the standard in use locally is located close to the equipment for reference

Additionally, the best results are attained when: slides are prepared well.

# 6. PROCEDURE

## 6.1. SAFETY

In the interest of safety:
- Put on a lab coat, safety goggles and gloves for protection.
- Make sure any long hair is pulled back away from face so as not to obscure vision or fall onto your workstation

## 6.2. WORKSTATION PREPARATION

- Have your Laminar Flow Cabinet set up and plugged in. 
- Turn on your Atomiser Machine to allow the top panel to warm up. 
- Prepare two scalpels, one for cutting open the air filter cartridges, one for cutting the air filter samples. _Do not cross-contaminate these scalpels_. 
- Draw 5μL of triacetin with the 10μL syringe and let it rest (triacetin is quite viscous, it takes about a minute to fill the micro-syringe). 
- Draw a ml of acetone in its syringe.
- Prepare a pair of tweezers for handling the air filter samples.
- Designate the air filter cartridges you will be making slides from.
- Prepare your box of slides and cover slips.
- Ensure you have a clean space to place your slides once they have been prepared.

## 6.3. SLIDE PREPARATION

- Place a clean slide in your workspace: if unsure of the cleanliness of the slide, use a Kimwipe and ethanol to clean the surface on which the filter is going to be mounted.
- Select an air filter cartridge and cut open the seal with the designated scalpel. Make sure that this scalpel is used only for opening cartridge seals, and never for cutting the filters.
- Take off the lid, take out the air filter sample with the tweezers and place it in the middle of your slide. 
- With the scalpel designated for cutting the air filter samples, carefully cut one quarter of the sample: the best result is achieved with a rocking movement of the scalpel blade in one single movement.
- Leave the quarter piece on the slide and place the rest of the air filter sample back in its cartridge along with the protective cover, and close back the lid.
- Rotate the piece of air fiber sample you cut out so that the inside corner is facing left, and the rounded outside portion is facing to the right.
- Once your sample is in a good position, carefully move it to the bottom shelf of the atomiser machine, under the atomising nozzle
- Take your acetone syringe, and carefully insert it into the top of the atomiser machine
- Very slowly, start injecting the acetone into the machine and stop as soon as the air fiber sample is saturated and becomes transparent. Do not over-saturate the air fiber sample
- Place the slide on the warm panel at the top of the atomiser machine to dry. Remove it after the filter has dried. Do not exceed 30 seconds
- Remove the slide and place it in your workspace again. If it is not yet dry, wait for it to do so
- Once dry, drop 5μL of triacetin from the syringe at the center of the quarter filter, ideally without air bubbles.
- Carefully place a cover slip over the quarter filter, ensuring it is covered completely and triacetin does not flow away. You can use the tweezers to help place the slip in place. Be cautious with the amount of force used as this can compromise the integrity of the sample. In no instance should the cover slip be adjusted or slid in place after being dropped.

OPTIONAL: If you need to keep this sample for an extended period of time, seal the edges of the cover slip with clear nail polish

- Once the slide is dry, outline the shape of the air fiber sample on the cover slip with the fine point marker pen
- Write the identifier of the sample on the edge of the slide. 

Repeat the above steps for any additional samples to be created.
